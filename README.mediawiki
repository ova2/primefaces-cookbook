== Getting Started ==

=== Prerequisites ===

* Install Git as described in the [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git Pro Git book].
* Install [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 3] if you don't have it as this project is a Maven based project.

=== Compile and Run Project ===

Open your console / terminal window and clone the repository with

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/ova2/primefaces-cookbook.git
</pre>

You can now explore the source code with samples, compile and run the project. To install the project, go to the project root folder <tt>primefaces-cookbook</tt> and type the following command

<pre>
mvn install
</pre>

The demo web application is prepared to run with Jetty 8 server. To run it with JSF MyFaces implementation, type in the console / terminal window

<pre>
mvn jetty:run
</pre>

To run it with JSF Mojarra implementation, type

<pre>
mvn jetty:run -Pmojarra
</pre>

This starts Jetty server and the demo app is available under the following URL in a web browser

<pre>
http://localhost:8080/primefaces-cookbook/
</pre>

Jetty will continue to run until you stop it with a <tt>Ctrl+C</tt> in the console / terminal window where it is running.

=== Download WAR file ===

We use Jenkins as continuous integration tool. It builds the project after each commit. You can download the runnable showcase from the [https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/view/Dashboard/job/ova2/job/primefaces-cookbook/lastBuild/org.primefaces.cookbook$showcase/ Jenkins' last build].
It's deployable on every Servlet 2.5 compatible servlet container.
